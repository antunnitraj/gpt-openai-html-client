# gpt-openai-html-client
GPT 3.5 Openai Client written in HTML and JavaScript

# Why did i make it?
I created this Website for ease of use. The API token is saved on a Client's computer and so are the chat logs which eliminates a need for a server. You just plop the API key there and go wild.

# What do i plan to add?
Currently the response from the openai API is just getting splitted whereever `\n` is and a "p" element gets created for each line. I want to add the "bold" and "code embed" feature but i am happy with this version too.
